      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to write a bit more again, and decided that my previous web page design was too awful to survive.
So there you go, a new design (powered by hugo, obviously), and new content coming soon!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a currently a Developer Advocate at Google Cloud Platform.
I have a passion for developer relations, specifically when it comes to Go. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working closely with the Go team at Google since 2012, and my goal has always been to make the language as accessible as possible to everyone.
The Go Developer Relations team was absorved by the Cloud team, and I ended up applying my previous strategy to Cloud Computing.</description>
