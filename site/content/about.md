I'm the VP of Developer Relations at [source{d}](https://sourced.tech).

I have a passion for developer relations, specifically when it comes to Go
and anything that can help developers be more productive and happier.

Previously, I was a Developer Advocate for the Go team at Google and
for Google Cloud Platform.
I've been working closely with the Go team at Google since 2012, and my
goal has always been to make the language as accessible as possible to everyone.

In this page you will find the projects I've worked on, such as
my YouTube series [justforfunc](https://youtube.com/c/justforfunc),
as well as some of my GitHub repos, blog posts, and some of the talks
I've given over the years.
