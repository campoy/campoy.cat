I'm a currently a Developer Advocate at Google Cloud Platform.

I have a passion for developer relations, specifically when it comes to Go.
I've been working closely with the Go team at Google since 2012, and my
goal has always been to make the language as accessible as possible to everyone.

The Go Developer Relations team joined the Google Cloud Advocacy team,
and I ended up applying my previous strategy to Cloud Computing.

In this page you will find the projects I've worked on, such as
the [Google Cloud Platform Podcast](http://gcppodcast.com) where I co-host next
to [Mark Mandel](https://twitter.com/Neurotic), or my YouTube series
[justforfunc](https://youtube.com/c/justforfunc), as well as some of my GitHub
repos, blog posts, and some of the talks I've given over the years.
