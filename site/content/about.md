I'm the VP of Product and Developer Relations at [Dgraph Labs](https://dgraph.io).

I have Software Engineer with a passion for Developer Experience,
Product Management and Developer Relations, building tools
that make developers more productive and happier.

Previously, I was a Developer Advocate for the
[Go team](https://go.dev) at [Google](https://google.com) and for
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).

I've been working closely with the Go team at Google since 2012, and my
goal has always been to make the language as accessible as possible to everyone.
And even after I left Google, I became a
[Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-francesc_campoy)

In this page you will find the projects I've worked on, such as
my YouTube series [justforfunc](https://youtube.com/c/justforfunc),
as well as some of my GitHub repos, blog posts, and some of the talks
I've given over the years.
