I'm the VP of Product and Developer Relations at [Dgraph Labs](https://dgraph.io).

I have Software Engineer with a passion for Developer Experience,
Product Management and Developer Relations, building tools
that make developers more productive and happier.

Previously, I lead Product and Developer Relations at [source{d}](https://scoured.tech) and, before that, I was a Developer Advocate for the
Go team at Google and for Google Cloud Platform.
I've been working closely with the Go team at Google since 2012, and my
goal has always been to make the language as accessible as possible to everyone.

In this page you will find the projects I've worked on, such as
my YouTube series [justforfunc](https://youtube.com/c/justforfunc),
as well as some of my GitHub repos, blog posts, and some of the talks
I've given over the years.
