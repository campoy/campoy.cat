Everybody that has written some Go knows about channels.
Most of us also know that the default value for channels is nil.
But not many of us know that this nil value is actually useful.

I got this same question on [twitter](https://twitter.com/francesc), from a developer
learning Go, wondering whether Go nil channels existed just for completeness.

It does makes sense to wonder whether they're useful, as their behavior seems to indicate
otherwise.

Given a `nil` channel `c`:

- `<-c` receiving from `c` blocks forever
- `c <- v` sending into `c` blocks forever
- `close(c)` closing `c` panics

But I still insist they are useful. Let me introduce a problem whose solution seems obvious
at first, but it is actually not as easy as one might think and actually benefits from nil channels.

## Merging channels

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a function that given
two channels `a` and `b` of some type returns one channel `c` of the same type.
Every element received in `a` or `b` will be sent to `c`, and once both `a` and
`b` are closed `c` will be closed too.

### An auxiliary function

Before we start, let's write a function that will help us test our solution.
This function returns a channel that will eventually receive, at random
intervals, all of the given values and finish by being closed.

{{<highlight go>}}
func asChan(vs ...int) <-chan int {
	c := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for _, v := range vs {
			c <- v
			time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1000)) * time.Millisecond)
		}
		close(c)
	}()
	return c
}
{{</highlight>}}

This function creates a channel, starts a new go routine that sends values to the
created channel, and finally returns the channel.

This is pretty common pattern when dealing with channels, so make sure you understand
how it works before you continue reading.

### Let's get started

Since we don't really have a preference over `a` or `b` we're going to avoid
creating a preference by choosing on which channel we should `range` first.
Let's instead keep the symmetry and use an infinite loop and `select` over both channels.

{{<highlight go>}}
func merge(a, b <-chan int) <-chan int {
	c := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		for {
			select {
			case v := <-a:
				c <- v
			case v := <-b:
				c <- v
			}
		}
	}()
	return c
}
{{</highlight>}}

This looks pretty good, let's write a quick test and run it.

{{<highlight go>}}
func main() {
	a := asChan(1, 3, 5, 7)
	b := asChan(2, 4, 6, 8)
	c := merge(a, b)
	for v := range c {
		fmt.Println(v)
	}
}
{{</highlight>}}

This should print 1 to 8 in some order and end successfully. Let's see what happens.

{{<highlight bash>}}
> go run main.go
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
ðŸ˜±
{{</highlight>}}

Ok, so clearly this is not good because the program doesn't ever finish.
Once it has printed the values from 1 to 8 it starts printing zeros forever.

### Handling closed channels

What happens when we receive from a closed channel? We get the default value
of the type of the channel. In our case, the type is `int` so the value is `0`.

We could check for channels being closed by comparing to zero, but what if one
of the values we received was a zero? Instead we can use the "value comma ok"
syntax:

{{<highlight go>}}
v, ok := <- c
{{</highlight>}}

When using this syntax `ok` is a boolean that will be `true` for as long the
channel is open. Knowing this we can avoid sending superfluous zeros into
`c`.

We should also stop iterating at some point ... so let's keep track of when
both channels are closed too.

{{<highlight go>}}
func merge(a, b <-chan int) <-chan int {
	c := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		adone, bdone := false, false
		for !adone || !bdone {
			select {
			case v, ok := <-a:
				if !ok {
					adone = true
					continue
				}
				c <- v
			case v, ok := <-b:
				if !ok {
					bdone = true
					continue
				}
				c <- v
			}
		}
	}()
	return c
}
{{</highlight>}}

This looks like it might work! Let's run it.

{{<highlight bash>}}
> go run main.go
1
2
3

fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!

goroutine 1 [chan receive]:
main.main()
        /Users/francesc/src/github.com/campoy/campoy.cat/site/static/code/nilchans/main.go:13 +0x186
exit status 2
{{</highlight>}}

Ooops, we forgot something. What could that be?
Well, we can see that there's only one go routine running and it's blocked on line 13.
That line is:

{{<highlight go>}}
	for v := range c {
{{</highlight>}}

Can you see what the problem is? Well, a `range` statement iterates over all the
values in a channel until the channel is closed. But who is closing the channel?

We forgot! Let's add a `defer` statement in our go routine to make sure the channel
is closed eventually.

{{<highlight go>}}
func merge(a, b <-chan int) <-chan int {
	c := make(chan int)

	go func() {
        defer close(c)
		adone, bdone := false, false
		for !adone || !bdone {
			select {
			case v, ok := <-a:
				if !ok {
					adone = true
					continue
				}
				c <- v
			case v, ok := <-b:
				if !ok {
					bdone = true
					continue
				}
				c <- v
			}
		}
	}()
	return c
}
{{</highlight>}}

Note that the `defer` statement is inside of the anonymous function called in a
new go routine, rather than inside of `merge`. Otherwise `c` would be closed as
soon as we exited `merge` and sending a value into it would panic.

Let's run it and see what happens.

{{<highlight bash>}}
> go run main.go
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
{{</highlight>}}

This looks great ... but is it?

### Busy loops

The code we wrote so far is pretty good.
It is functionally correct, but if you deployed this in production you might
end up running into performance troubles.

In order to show you where the problem is, let's add a bit of logging.

{{<highlight go>}}
func merge(a, b <-chan int) <-chan int {
	c := make(chan int)

	go func() {
        defer close(c)
		adone, bdone := false, false
		for !adone || !bdone {
			select {
			case v, ok := <-a:
				if !ok {
                    log.Println("a is done")
					adone = true
					continue
				}
				c <- v
			case v, ok := <-b:
				if !ok {
                    log.Println("b is done")
					bdone = true
					continue
				}
				c <- v
			}
		}
	}()
	return c
}
{{</highlight>}}

Let's run it and see what happens.

{{<highlight go>}}
> go run main.go

a is done
2018/01/14 20:47:22 b is done
... ðŸ˜±
2018/01/14 20:47:23 b is done
2018/01/14 20:47:23 a is done
{{</highlight>}}

Uh oh! It seems once a channel is done we keep on iterating non-stop!
It does make sense after all.
As we saw at the beginning reading from a closed channel never blocks.
Therefore the `select` statement will block as long as both channels are
open until a new element is ready, but once one of them closes we will
iterate and waste CPU.
This is also known as a busy loop, and it's not good.

### Disabling a case in a select statement

In order to avoid the busy loop describe previously we would like to disable
a part of the `select` statement. Concretely, we'd like to remove
`case v, ok := <- a` when `a` is closed and similarly for `b`.
But how?

As we mentioned at the beginning, receiving from a nil channels blocks forever.
So to disable a `case` receiving from a channel, we can simply set that channel
to `nil`!

We can then stop using `adone` and `bdone` and instead check for `a` and `b`
being `nil`.

{{<highlight go>}}
func merge(a, b <-chan int) <-chan int {
	c := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		defer close(c)
		for a != nil || b != nil {
			select {
			case v, ok := <-a:
				if !ok {
					fmt.Println("a is done")
					a = nil
					continue
				}
				c <- v
			case v, ok := <-b:
				if !ok {
					fmt.Println("b is done")
					b = nil
					continue
				}
				c <- v
			}
		}
	}()
	return c
}
{{</highlight>}}

Ok, hopefully this will avoid unnecessary loops. Let's try it.

{{<highlight bash>}}
> go run main.go
2
1

b is done
a is done
{{</highlight>}}
