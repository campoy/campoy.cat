Thanks and goodbye, Google friends.

It was six years and a half ago, and with a thick French accent, that I joined Google as a Software Engineer for AdWords. Little I knew then that I would join Developer Relations and the Go team a year later, where I found my passion for developer relations and gophers. It's been a wild ride full of amazing experiences and many learning opportunities. I've been always surrounded by an incredibly supportive group of awesome coworkers, so to you all, thanks for being there.

I've decided that the time has come for me to go on a new adventure and seek new learning opportunities outside of Google and try my luck in a small startup with huge potential.

Worry not, I won't go far! I'll be in San Francisco working from home for now - which means no more free lunches (wink, wink).
But what I will miss the most from Google is not the free food, it's all of you. Working surrounded by such brilliant people has been a blessing, and I hope to keep in touch with all of you.

I will keep on working on [justforfunc](http://justforfunc.com) and being an active
part of the Go community and the [Community Outreach Working Group](https://blog.golang.org/community-outreach-working-group) too.

November 1st will be my last day at Google, and that evening I will be flying to Paris for [dotGo](https://dotgo.eu), soon to be followed by my trip to [Gophercon Brasil](https://2017.gopherconbr.org/). Let's celebrate if you're around.

Uncomfortably excited,

Francesc
